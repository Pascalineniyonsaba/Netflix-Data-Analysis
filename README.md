# Netflix Data Analysis with Python : Unveiling Insights and Trends

## Project Overview
Welcome to the Netflix Data Analysis project! In this repository, I explore the Netflix dataset using Python for data analysis. My goal is to uncover interesting insights and trends within the vast collection of movies and TV shows available on Netflix.
## Data sources 
This Netflix dataset has information about the tv shows and Movies available on Netflix till 2021  
The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine,and available on Kaggle website for free
## Tools Used:
- Python 
- Pandas   
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization

## Data cleaning /preparation
In the initial data preparation phase,I performed the following tasks : 
1. Data loading and inspectation
2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and formatting

## Exporatory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is crucial for understanding the Netflix dataset, uncovering patterns, trends, and insights. In this section, we explore various aspects of the dataset to gain a comprehensive understanding of the content available on Netflix, addressing key questions:

1. **Release Trends Over the Years:**
   - In which year did the highest number of TV shows and movies release? (Visualized using a Bar Graph)

2. **Movies and TV Shows by Top 10 Directors:**
   - Show all records where the category is "Movie" and type is "Comedians" or the country is "United Kingdom." Additionally, display the top 10 directors who gave the highest number of TV shows and movies to Netflix. (Visualized using a Bar Graph)

3. **Different Ratings Defined by Netflix:**
   - What are the different ratings defined by Netflix?
